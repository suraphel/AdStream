Absolutely, Suri! Here's a **cleaned-up and reusable version** of your prompt — clearly structured, modular, and applicable to **any main category and its subcategories**, not just Vehicles.

### ✅ Feature Implementation Prompt for Classified Categories

**Objective:**
Enhance category and subcategory pages on the existing classified ads platform by adding a **collapsible filter sidebar**, **breadcrumb navigation**, and a **dynamic item listing section**. This should work for **any category** (e.g., Vehicles, Electronics, Real Estate) with its own subpages and filter options.

---

### 🧩 Layout & Functional Breakdown

#### 1. **Breadcrumb Navigation**

* Show users their current path, e.g.:

  ```
  Home > Vehicles > Cars
  ```
* Display it at the top of the category/subcategory pages.
* Clicking a breadcrumb link navigates one level up.

#### 2. **Subcategories**

* Display subcategories relevant to the selected main category.
* Each subcategory should be a **clickable card/button**, redirecting to its own page:

  ```
  /vehicles/cars
  /vehicles/vans
  /vehicles/motorhomes
  ```
* This subcategory list should be reusable across categories (e.g., Electronics → Phones, Laptops, TVs).

---

### 📂 3. **Collapsible Filter Sidebar**

* The filter sidebar should appear on the **left side** of the category or subcategory page.
* It should be **collapsible**, with a default state of collapsed.
* A button like **"Show Filters" / "Hide Filters"** should toggle its visibility.

#### 💡 General Filter Structure (for reuse across categories):

```text
Filter Sidebar (Collapsible)
├── Price Range (slider)
├── Condition (checkbox or dropdown): New, Used
├── Location (dropdown or search): e.g., Addis Ababa, Mekelle, etc.
├── [Category-Specific Filters]
```

#### ✅ Example: For `/vehicles` and its subpages, filters include:

* **Price Range**: Slider in ETB (Ethiopian Birr)
* **Condition**: New, Used (checkboxes or dropdown)
* **Location**: Dropdown with Ethiopian cities
* **Transmission Type**: Automatic, Manual
* **Mileage**: Range slider (0–200,000+ km)
* **Car Brands**:

  * Show common car brands in Ethiopia as **scrollable checkboxes**
    (e.g., Toyota, Hyundai, Mercedes, BMW, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Kia, Ford, Honda, Suzuki)
  * Allow **multi-select**
  * Include a **"Select All"** option

> ✅ This filter layout should be **extensible** — for example, if you’re in `/electronics`, you can replace "Car Brands" with "Laptop Brands", "Phone Brands", etc.

### 📦 4. **Items List**

* The items list should reflect:

  * The selected subcategory (e.g., Cars under Vehicles)
  * The active filters
* Each item should show:

  * **Title**
  * **Price (in ETB)**
  * **Thumbnail Image**
  * **Short description**
* Results should support:

  * **Pagination** or **Infinite Scroll**
  * Responsive updates based on filters

---

### 📱 5. **Mobile Responsiveness**

* Filters should collapse into an **accordion menu** or slide-over drawer on mobile.
* Subcategories should be easily tappable as cards or buttons.
* Breadcrumbs should shrink or stack vertically if needed.

---

### 🌍 6. **Localization & Market Fit**

* **Location** dropdowns should list **Ethiopian cities** like:

  * Addis Ababa
  * Dire Dawa
  * Mekelle
  * Bahir Dar
  * Hawassa
* Currency for all price inputs and outputs should be in **ETB**.
* Car brands and filters should reflect what’s relevant in the **Ethiopian market**.

---

### ✅ Key Expected Outcomes

* ✅ Clicking a main category (e.g., Vehicles) routes to `/vehicles`
* ✅ `/vehicles` displays subcategories (e.g., Cars, Vans, Motorhomes) as clickable entries
* ✅ Clicking a subcategory (e.g., Cars) routes to `/vehicles/cars`
* ✅ Breadcrumb navigation reflects the page hierarchy (`Home > Vehicles > Cars`)
* ✅ A collapsible sidebar appears on category and subcategory pages
* ✅ Filters are category-aware and include price, condition, location, and specific filters like car brands
* ✅ Items update dynamically as filters are applied
* ✅ Layout is responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile

---

### ♻️ Reusability Note

This architecture is reusable for all main categories:

* Use a **filter configuration map** per category to define available filters.
* Subcategory rendering and breadcrumbs follow the same structure regardless of main category.
* Filter components and layout behavior stay consistent — only their **data** changes.

Let me know if you want a JSON or TypeScript config structure to define category-specific filters — would be a great next step to make this fully modular.
